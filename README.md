# KOIBANX API

Koibanx is an API that currently contains two endpoints for:

1. Consult all shops.
2. Add a new shop.

This is my proposed solution to the exam for the vacancy as a software engineer.

## Installation

To use the API you use:

- nodeJS v17.8.0
- npm 8.5.5

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

## Notes

1. Files of type env are not added to gitignore for testing purposes.
2. In the challenge instructions is mentioned that for authentication the user test@koibanx.com has the password test123, however, in the code the password with which it was created is admin.
3. The currency that was handled is in MXN.
