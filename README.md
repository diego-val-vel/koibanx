# KOIBANX API

Koibanx is an API that currently contains two endpoints for:

1. Consult all shops.
2. Add a new shop.

This is my proposed solution to the exam for the vacancy as a software engineer.

## Installation

To use the API you use:

- nodeJS v17.8.0
- npm 8.5.5

```bash
npm i
npm start
```
